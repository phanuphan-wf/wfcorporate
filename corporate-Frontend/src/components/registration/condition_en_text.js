    </p>
    <h5 className="text-xl font-medium">
      World Fair Co., Ltd. may use your personal data for the following
      purposes:
    </h5>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        To evaluate marketing activities, advertisements, and websites created

      How the Company Permits the Use of Personal Data
    </h5>
    <p>
      The Company may allow third parties to use your data in certain cases,
      including:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interest-Based Advertising</strong> The Company engages in
      interest-based advertising (online behavioral advertising). Third parties
      may use technologies such as cookies on your browser to identify you on
      the Company's website and advertise products and services tailored to your
      interests. You may see advertisements on the Company's website that align
      with your browsing or purchasing behavior or see advertisements for the
      Company's products on other websites based on your behavior on various
      websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Blogs, Online Posts, and Testimonials</strong> The Company may
      allow users to comment, post messages, provide testimonials, or share
      other information. If you choose to submit such information to the
      Company, it may be disclosed to the public. Information you provide in
      this context may be read, collected, and used by others who access it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Third Parties</strong> The Company may allow unnamed third parties
      to use non-personal data. In such cases, the Company may aggregate or
      anonymize the data to prevent it from being linked to you, your computer,
      or your device. Aggregation means combining non-personal data from various
      individuals to make it unrelated to any specific person. Anonymization
      means removing or altering parts of the data that could link it to a
      specific individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Law Enforcement and Legal Processes</strong> The Company may
      notify law enforcement agencies of activities it reasonably believes to be
      unlawful or that may assist in investigations to enforce the law against
      unlawful activities. Additionally, the Company reserves the right to
      disclose your data to law enforcement agencies if it reasonably believes
      you have violated the Company's policies or if disclosure is necessary to
      protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company or others.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Permitted Use of Your Data by Law</strong> The Company may allow
      third parties to use your data as permitted or required by law, including
      sharing your data with government agencies or others under subpoenas,
      court orders, or other legal processes, or as the Company believes
      necessary to exercise its legal rights, defend against legal claims, or
      address potential legal claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Business Transactions: In some cases, the Company may decide to sell, buy,
      merge, or restructure its business, which may require disclosing personal
      data to potential or actual buyers. In such cases, the Company follows
      appropriate disclosure practices to protect the data during these
      transactions.
